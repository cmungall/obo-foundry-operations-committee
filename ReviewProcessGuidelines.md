This page deals with policies and guidelines for the process of ontology review, particularly operational aspects such as:

  * which ontologies should be reviewed, and in what order?
  * how should reviewers be chosen?
  * what is the workflow for conducting a review?
  * how will conflicts be resolved?

[ReviewCriteriaPolicies](http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/wiki/ReviewCriteriaPolicies) covers guidelines and policies for the criteria by which an ontology should be reviewed.

# How to request an ontology review #

  1. Go to the OBO Foundry Operations Committee [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/issues/list).
  1. Click on "New issue".
  1. Select the "Review request" template and follow the instructions on the template.

# Ontology review priority #

Ontologies will be reviewed in the order in which the review request is received. If an ontology previously submitted a request for an OBO Foundry review (that is, before this committee was formed), then the date of the original request is used to determine priority.

Any ontology group wanting a review by the Editorial WG must submit a request on the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/obo-foundry-operations-committee/issues/list)
